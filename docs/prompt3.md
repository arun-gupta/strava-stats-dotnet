Step 3: Create `docs/tasks.md`
- Based on the implementation plan in `docs/plan.md`, produce a **detailed enumerated technical task list**:
    - Each task must have a placeholder `[ ]` to mark completion.
    - Link each task both to:
        - the development plan item in `docs/plan.md`
        - the related requirement(s) in `docs/requirements.md`
- Group tasks into **development phases**.
- Organize phases logically (e.g., Setup → Core Features → Advanced Features → Testing & QA).
