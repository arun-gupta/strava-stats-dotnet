Step 2: Create `docs/plan.md`
- Analyze `docs/requirements.md`.
- Develop a **detailed implementation plan**:
    - Link each plan item explicitly to the corresponding requirements.
    - Assign priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
    - Group related plan items logically.
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all requirements.
